# **CodeWars Challenges: [Visit here](https://www.codewars.com/users/datregu)**

This is a repository with all the codewars challenges (kata) that I resolve. I try to push 1 solution per day.

## How it's made:
**Tech used**: ![JavaScript-logo](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9496882abd182958bcea4238ab44f7eb8928d7a4144c150f18f6c55ceb9b4490/68747470733a2f2f6564656e742e6769746875622e696f2f537570657254696e7949636f6e732f696d616765732f7376672f6a6176617363726970742e737667)
## Optimizations:
Every time I resolve a kata I try to refactor and optimize my code, adding features like psedo-code for readability.
## Lessons Learned:
I learn lessons with every kata I push, but one thing is for sure, even if a problem can have different solutions, we must seek for the ones more that are more efficient.

This is a repository with all the codewars challenges (kata) that I resolve. I try to push 1 solution per day.

## How it's made:
**Tech used**: ![JavaScript-logo](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/30934920b46fd5b6874bf6ce5f9a3afd8ea0e5e4ed20ab9eda0450286ba7a138/68747470733a2f2f696d672e736869656c64732e696f2f7374617469632f76313f6c6162656c3d7c266d6573736167653d4a41564153435249505426636f6c6f723d336337663564267374796c653d706c6173746963266c6f676f3d6a617661736372697074)
## Optimizations:
Every time I resolve a kata I try to refactor and optimize my code, adding features like psedo-code for readability.
## Lessons Learned:
I learn lessons with every kata I push, but one thing is for sure, even if a problem can have different solutions, we must seek for the ones more that are more efficient.
